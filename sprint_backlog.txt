BranchName: ReflectionEssay
Description:
1. Discuss what you learned and compare and contrast the kinds of questions can
   be asked and answered by the data queries vs. the visualization. Examples: wh   at limitations are introduced by the data elements (e.g. World Bank income
   levels)? what granularity of data is provided by the visualization?

2. Explore an ethical issue introduced by the data and explained by the data.
   Examples: you could choose a specific country and research why measles
   vaccine rates developed as they did (e.g. effects of colonization, funding,
   political opposition, etc.); you could investigate the role of the World Bank
   and World Health Organization and how they make these measurements and what
   purposes they serve.

Each part should take between 750-1000 words. Standard academic formatting and
citations should be used (e.g. in-text citations using APA format; a final
References list should be provided).
