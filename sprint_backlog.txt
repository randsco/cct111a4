the name of the input file). If it is unable to open that file, the program will
halt with an error message.

Description:
The program will prompt the user for the name of the output file. If that file
does not exist, the program will create it and continue. If that file does
exist, the program will discard the current contents of the file and continue
(it will overwrite it).

BranchName: ReflectionEssay
Description:
1. Discuss what you learned and compare and contrast the kinds of questions can
   be asked and answered by the data queries vs. the visualization. Examples: wh   at limitations are introduced by the data elements (e.g. World Bank income
   levels)? what granularity of data is provided by the visualization?

2. Explore an ethical issue introduced by the data and explained by the data.
   Examples: you could choose a specific country and research why measles
   vaccine rates developed as they did (e.g. effects of colonization, funding,
   political opposition, etc.); you could investigate the role of the World Bank
   and World Health Organization and how they make these measurements and what
   purposes they serve.

Each part should take between 750-1000 words. Standard academic formatting and
citations should be used (e.g. in-text citations using APA format; a final
References list should be provided).

Description:
The program will copy selected lines from “measles.csv” into a file selected by
the user.

Start: December 6 3:00pm
End: December 6 5:30pm
BranchName: UserStory4
Description:
The program will prompt the user to enter a year, and will then prompt the user
to enter an income level. The income level must be one of the characters in the
set {1, 2, 3, 4}, where 1 corresponds to “low income”, 2 corresponds to “lower
middle income”, 3 corresponds to “upper middle income” and 4 corresponds to
“high income”.

BranchName: UserStory5
Description:
The program will copy all data of “measles.csv” selected by the user’s response.
A column is selected if the user’s response matches the Year field. A row
(country) is selected if the income level matches. All data (in either/both rows
and columns) are selected if the user’s response is “all” or “ALL”.
For example, a line whose Year field contains “1987” would be selected by any of
the following user responses: “1987”, “all”, “”ALL”.
The output file created by the program will have the same format as the input
file. Note that when the user selects all lines, the output file will be
identical to the input file.
