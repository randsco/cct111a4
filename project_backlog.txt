Project Backlog AKA "Things to do".

What is a Project Backlog?
The project backlog is a list of tasks to be claimed and completed. Copy, delete
and paste a user story from here into sprint_backlog.txt to claim it.
Then create a new branch for yourself to work on that task with the command
"git branch BranchName"
and switch to that branch with
"git checkout BranchName"
The branch names are listed below beside "BranchName:".

What is a User Story?
A user story is a feature of a program. It details what the program should do in
response to a potential user's actions. Our job is to create a program that will
respond exactly how the user story describes it.

V------List of User Stories to be Completed------V

BranchName: UserStory5
Description:
The program will copy all data of “measles.csv” selected by the user’s response.
A column is selected if the user’s response matches the Year field. A row
(country) is selected if the income level matches. All data (in either/both rows
and columns) are selected if the user’s response is “all” or “ALL”.
For example, a line whose Year field contains “1987” would be selected by any of
the following user responses: “1987”, “all”, “”ALL”.
The output file created by the program will have the same format as the input
file. Note that when the user selects all lines, the output file will be
identical to the input file.


BranchName: UserStory7
Description:
The program will display appropriate messages to inform the user about any
errors.
