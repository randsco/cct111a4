Project Backlog AKA "Things to do".

What is a Project Backlog?
The project backlog is a list of tasks to be claimed and completed. Copy, delete
and paste a user story from here into sprint_backlog.txt to claim it.
Then create a new branch for yourself to work on that task with the command
"git branch BranchName"
and switch to that branch with
"git checkout BranchName"
The branch names are listed below beside "BranchName:".

What is a User Story?
A user story is a feature of a program. It details what the program should do in
response to a potential user's actions. Our job is to create a program that will
respond exactly how the user story describes it.
